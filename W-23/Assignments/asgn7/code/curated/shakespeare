    'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,
    Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,         164
    Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;
    Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
    Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;
    Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.            168

    'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,
    Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
    By law of nature thou art bound to breed,
    That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;      172
    And so in spite of death thou dost survive,
    In that thy likeness still is left alive.'

    By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,
    For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,      176
    And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat
    With burning eye did hotly overlook them,
    Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,
    So he were like him and by Venus' side.            180

    And now Adonis with a lazy spright,
    And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,
    His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,
    Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,           184
    Souring his cheeks, cries, 'Fie! no more of love:
    The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.'
