\section{Gnu Plot (\texttt{gnuplot})}

\texttt{gnuplot} is a utility that can be run on a variety of platforms (Linux,
macOS, Windows, and many more) used to generate high-quality plots and graphs.
Unlike Excel, \texttt{gnuplot} is used through the command-line --- the shell.
Although you can use it interactively, issuing commands and having the current
plot be redrawn, \texttt{gnuplot} is capable of running commands in batch,
lending itself very naturally for use in a \Bash{} script. To install
\texttt{gnuplot} on Linux:

\begin{shlisting}{}
$ sudo apt install gnuplot
\end{shlisting}

\texttt{gnuplot} is mostly used to plot data points in a file. The basic format
is very simplistic: just a series of $(x, y)$ coordinates on each line, separated
by whitespace.

\begin{pylisting}{Example data file: \texttt{example.dat}.}
1 5
2 4
3 3
4 2
5 1
\end{pylisting}

After you've created this file, start up \texttt{gnuplot}. This should open up
an interactive prompt. From here, all we need to do is specify what data file to
plot and how to plot it.

\begin{shlisting}{}
$ gnuplot

        gnuplot home:     http://www.gnuplot.info
        faq, bugs, etc:   type "help FAQ"
        immediate help:   type "help"  (plot window: hit 'h')

Terminal type is now 'qt'
gnuplot> plot "example.dat" with linespoints
\end{shlisting}

Entering this command into \texttt{gnuplot} should result in the plot popping up
in a window. We would also like to be able to export a plot to a file, say a
PDF. We'd also prefer if we didn't have to interactively type out what to plot
each time. There is where the non-interactive mode for \texttt{gnuplot} comes
in. We can create a file listing the commands we'd ordinarily issue to
\texttt{gnuplot} interactively and instruct it to output the plot to a PDF of
our choosing.

\begin{pylisting}{Example \texttt{gnuplot} file: \texttt{example.plot}.}
set terminal pdf
set output "example.pdf"
set xlabel "x"
set ylabel "y"
plot "example.dat" with linespoints
\end{pylisting}

We now redirect the contents of \texttt{example.plot} into \texttt{gnuplot},
which should generate the plot in a file named \texttt{example.pdf}. The plot
should resemble Figure \ref{figure:example}. We'll learn more about file
redirection when we discuss basic \Bash{} scripting in \S\ref{section:bash}.

\begin{shlisting}{}
$ gnuplot < example.plot
\end{shlisting}

\begin{figure}[bth]
  \centering
  \input{figures/example.tex}
  \caption{\label{figure:example}
    Example plot generated by \texttt{gnuplot}.
  }
\end{figure}

You can learn more about \texttt{gnuplot} and view more extensive examples,
respectively, with the following links:

There is also a built-in help system in \texttt{gnuplot}. Just type
``help'' when you are in interactive mode.

Do you have to use \texttt{gnuplot} for your course assignments? Yes. What about
Excel? No. What about some random online tool? No. You have to learn and use a
\Unix{} command line tool. If you are extremely insistent on not using
\texttt{gnuplot}, you can use \texttt{matplotlib} for Python as an alternative.
But you're on your own there.
