\begin{document}\maketitle
In his piece "Censorship and Silence," Umberto Eco delves into the
concept of censorship in Italian culture and how it has evolved
over time. He uses the word "veline" to illustrate the changing
meanings of words and how they reflect societal attitudes towards
censorship.

Eco points out that in the past, "veline" referred to sheets of
paper sent by the government to newspapers during the Fascist regime.
These sheets instructed the newspapers on what to censor and what
to print, symbolizing censorship through silence. This form of
censorship, as Eco notes, is characterized by the suppression of
information and the concealment of certain events or ideas. This
type of censorship is more subtle but equally insidious as it can
control the narrative and shape the public's perception of events
and ideas.

On the other hand, Eco highlights how the modern meaning of the
word "veline" refers to television showgirls and the celebration
of visibility and fame, which he calls censorship through noise.
This form of censorship is characterized by the overwhelming amount
of information and the constant bombardment of images and ideas,
which can distract and ultimately numb the audience.

Eco's analysis of the changing meaning of the word "veline" is a
powerful reminder that censorship can take on different forms and
can be achieved through different means. Both forms of censorship,
silence, and noise, have the same goal, which is to control the
narrative and shape the public's perception of events and ideas.

Moreover, Eco notes that Fascism understood the power of the media
in shaping behavior and that certain events only came to national
attention because of media coverage. This highlights how censorship
can be used not only to control what people know, but also how they
think, and how their thoughts and actions are influenced by the
information they receive.

In addition to discussing censorship through silence, Eco also
addresses censorship through noise. He describes it as a form of
censorship that is achieved through the saturation of information,
where an overwhelming amount of images and ideas can distract and
numb the audience. The constant bombardment of information can make
it difficult for individuals to discern what is important and
credible, leading to a lack of critical thinking and analysis. This
form of censorship can also be used to shape public opinion and
control the narrative by flooding the information space with a
particular point of view. This is a powerful reminder of the dangers
of information overload and the importance of being able to discern
credible information from disinformation in today's society. The
noise can also be used to distract people from important issues,
which is a form of censorship in itself. Noise can be used as a
tool to silence the voices that are needed to be heard in the public
sphere.

In conclusion, Umberto Eco's analysis of censorship in Italian
culture through the use of the word "veline" is a powerful reminder
of how censorship can take on different forms and how it can be
achieved through different means. He emphasizes the importance of
understanding both forms of censorship, silence and noise, and their
impact on shaping the narrative and public perception.
