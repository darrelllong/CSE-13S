Stephenson, \emph{In the Beginning\ldots Was the Command Line}}

Your program should accept the following command-line options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{-t}\ : Specify that the Game of Life is to be played on a \emph{toroidal}
    universe.
  \item \texttt{-s}\ : Silence \texttt{ncurses}. Enabling this option means
    that nothing should be displayed by \texttt{ncurses}.
  \item \texttt{-n} \emph{generations}\ : Specify the number of generations that the
    universe goes through. The default number of generations is 100.
  \item \texttt{-i} \emph{input}\ : Specify the input file to read in order to populate
    the universe. By default the input should be \texttt{stdin}.
  \item \texttt{-o} \emph{output}\ : Specify the output file to print the final state
    of the universe to. By default the output should be \texttt{stdout}.
\end{itemize}
