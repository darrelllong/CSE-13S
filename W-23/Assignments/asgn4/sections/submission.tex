Refer back assignment 0 for the instructions on how to properly submit
your assignment through \texttt{git}. Remember: \emph{add},
\emph{commit}, and \emph{push}!

\textcolor{red}{Your assignment is turned in \emph{only} after you have
pushed and submitted the commit ID you want graded on Canvas. ``I
forgot to push'' and ``I forgot to submit my commit ID'' are not valid
excuses. It is \emph{highly} recommended to commit and push your changes
\emph{often}.}

We will provide you with an working reference program that can be found in the
resources repository. Your code must produce \emph{exactly} the same output for
\emph{all} inputs in order to receive full credit. You can use the \texttt{diff}
command to compare results.
