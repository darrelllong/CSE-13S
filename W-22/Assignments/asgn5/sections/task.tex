\section{Your Task}
\epigraph{\emph{``Personally,'' he said, ``my great ambition is to count all this,''---he waved
vaguely at the treasure around him---``and possibly sort it into piles.''}}{John C.\xspace Gardner, \emph{Grendel}}

\noindent You will be creating three programs for this assignment:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A key generator: \texttt{keygen}
  \item An encryptor: \texttt{encrypt}
  \item A decryptor: \texttt{decrypt}
\end{enumerate}

The \texttt{keygen} program will be in charge of key generation,
producing RSA public and private key pairs. The \texttt{encrypt} program
will encrypt files using a public key, and the \texttt{decrypt} program
will decrypt the encrypted files using the corresponding private key.

You will need to implement two libraries and a random state module that
will be used in each of your programs. One of the libraries will be hold
functions relating to the mathematics behind RSA, and the other library
itself will contain implementations of routines for RSA\@. You also need
to learn to \emph{use} a library: the GNU multiple precision arithmetic
library.
