The Game of Life should be played on a potentially \emph{infinite},
two-dimensional (2-D) grid of cells that represents a \emph{universe}. Each cell
has two possible states: it is either \emph{dead} or \emph{alive}. The game
progresses through \emph{generations}, what some might call ``steps in time.''
There are only three rules that determine the state of the universe after each
generation:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Any \emph{live} cell with two or three live neighbors \emph{survives}.
  \item Any \emph{dead} cell with exactly three live neighbors \emph{becomes a live cell}.
  \item All other cells die, either due to loneliness or overcrowding.
\end{enumerate}

Your task for this assignment is to implement the Game of Life in \textbf{C}.
The first hurdle is creating an abstraction for the universe in which the game
is played.
