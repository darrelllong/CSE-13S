\section{Your Task}

As stated previously, your task for this assignment is to write a shell script,
or more specifically, a \Bash{} script. You will use this script to
produce plots of a provided \C{} program. The provided program can be
found in the resources repository.

All the program does is print the Collatz sequence starting from some positive
integer $n$. For those unacquainted with Collatz sequences, or more broadly, the
\emph{Collatz conjecture}, the setup is as follows: We will create a sequence of
integers $S$ starting with some positive integer $n$. That is, $S_1 = n$. The
next term of the sequence is based on the previous term of the sequence. In this
case, $S_2$, the second term of the sequence, is based on $S_1$, the first term
of the sequence. For any $S_{k+1}$ where $k > 0$, the following relation holds:
$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{k+1} =
  \begin{cases}
    1+3S_k  &\text{if $S_k$ is odd} \\
    \frac{1}{2}S_k &\text{if $S_k$ is even}
  \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$
The conjecture itself is that any sequence following this relation always ends
with the last term being $1$, no matter what $n$ was used to start the sequence
with. This has never been proved. If you do find a sequence that does not terminate, then you \emph{may be famous}, but more likely \emph{your code has a bug}.
According to Paul Erd\H{o}s, ``Mathematics may
not be ready for such problems.''

Using the provided Collatz program, you are expected to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Familiarize yourself with the syntax of \C{}.
  \item Understand what the provided program is doing. You will want to attend
    section for any parts you are unsure about.
  \item Produce interesting plots using the Collatz sequences produced by the
    provided program. You should use \texttt{gnuplot} to produce these plots,
    and everything should be automated by means of a \Bash{} script.
\end{enumerate}

Refer to Figures \ref{figure:collatz-length}, \ref{figure:collatz-maxval}, and
\ref{figure:collatz-hist} for example plots that were created using the provided
program. Now that you know your task, we will now give a brief overview on
\Bash{} scripting.
