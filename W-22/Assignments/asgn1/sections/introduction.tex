\section{Introduction}

\noindent The purpose of this assignment is to get you acquainted with a \Unix
system and to get familiar with the syntax of a basic \C program. You won't need
to write any \C code for this assignment, but it is expected that you go through
and understand the code given to you. This assignment itself will require the
use of \Bash, a general purpose scripting language. You may wonder why,
especially in a course dedicated for introductory \C programming, you're
expected to learn the basic of \Bash, but it will prove useful to you as a
programmer down the road and will aid in getting you comfortable with working in
a \Unix command line, or a \emph{shell}.
