\section{Honesty}

Academic honesty is very important in computer science, and life in
general. The goal of this course is for you to learn the material, not
simply for you to get a mark on your transcript saying you passed the
class. All students in the class must sign and turn in an acknowledgment
that they understand the cheating policy for the class.
\textcolor{red}{We will not accept or grade any assignments from a
student unless they have turned in the \texttt{CHEATING.pdf}.} We
encourage you to ask for clarifications in the academic policy if you
have any questions.
