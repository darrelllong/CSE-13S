\texttt{git}.}{---Alexei Sayle}

\noindent The aim of this first assignment will be for you to set up your
GitLab repositories and gain an understanding of how \texttt{git} works.
We will review several \texttt{git} commands that you will help you in the long
run. This document will be helpful for troubleshooting \texttt{git} issues in
the future and also includes the submission policy. You will find this quite
helpful in the future if you ever have any issues with \texttt{git} or
submitting. \emph{Ideally,} this assignment should be completed during your
discussion section.
