\section{Your Task}\label{sec:task}

Your task is to implement two programs called \texttt{encode} and
\texttt{decode} which perform LZ78 compression and decompression, respectively.
The requirements for your programs are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{encode} can compress any file, text or binary.
    \item \texttt{decode} can decompress any file, text or binary, that was
        compressed with \texttt{encode}.
    \item Both operate on both little and big endian systems.
        \emph{Interoperability is required}.
    \item Both use variable bit-length codes.
    \item Both perform read and writes in efficient blocks of 4KB.
    \item Both \texttt{encode} and \texttt{decode} must interoperate
        with the provided binaries -- not just your code.
\end{enumerate}

You will need to implement some new ADTs to complete your encoder and decoder:
\emph{tries} and \emph{words}. In addition to these new ADTs, you will need to
be concerned about variable-length codes, I/O, and endianness.
