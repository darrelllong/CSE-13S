\section{Submission}

Refer back assignment 0 for the instructions on how to properly submit your
assignment through \texttt{git}. Remember: \emph{add}, \emph{commit}, and
\emph{push}!

\textcolor{red}{Your assignment is turned in \emph{only} after you have pushed
and submitted the commit ID you want graded on Canvas. ``I forgot to push'' and
``I forgot to submit my commit ID'' are not valid excuses. It is \emph{highly}
recommended to commit and push your changes \emph{often}.}
