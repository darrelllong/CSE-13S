\section{Introduction}

Stylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style. That is, by
analyzing the linguistic styles, or \emph{diction}, of certain authors, it
becomes possible to identify the author of some anonymous sample of text by
comparing its linguistic style to the styles of the analyzed authors. In
practice, stylometry has been used for more than just author identification, but
also composer identification, artist identification, and even programmer
identification. With regard to the latter, stylometry has even been used to
detect code plagiarism, flagging cases where the code style is too similar.

For your assignment, you will be creating a program that attempts to identify
the most likely authors for an anonymous sample of text given a large database
of texts with known authors. Modern-day stylometry usually is performed using
machine learning, achieving high identification accuracies by learning over
time, but implementing this from scratch would take an extraordinary effort. We
instead will settle and be content with using an algorithm that's commonly used
in machine learning to identify authors of anonymous samples of text, albeit
less accurately. What is this algorithm? It is the $k$-nearest neighbors
algorithm.
