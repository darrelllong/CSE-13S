## Secondary Scripts

This directory contains secondary scripts for each of the assignments.
The secondary script must be called "grade.sh" and should have explicit
exit status codes: 0 for success and 1 for failure. This exit status
code is what enables the main grading script, "grading.sh" to know
whether or not a student managed to get correct output or not.
