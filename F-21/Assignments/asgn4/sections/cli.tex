\noindent
Your program must support any combination of the following command-line
options.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\texttt{-h}}\,: Prints out a help message describing the purpose
    of the graph and the command-line options it accepts, exiting the
    program afterwards. Refer to the reference program in the resources
    repo for an idea of what to print.
  \item \textbf{\texttt{-v}}\,: Enables verbose printing. If enabled,
    the program prints out \emph{all} Hamiltonian paths found as well as
    the total number of recursive calls to \texttt{dfs()}.
  \item \textbf{\texttt{-u}}\,: Specifies the graph to be undirected.
  \item \textbf{\texttt{-i infile}}\,: Specify the input file path
    containing the cities and edges of a graph. If not specified, the
    default input should be set as \texttt{stdin}.
  \item \textbf{\texttt{-o outfile}}\,: Specify the output file path to
    print to. If not specified, the default output should be set as
    \texttt{stdout}.
\end{itemize}
