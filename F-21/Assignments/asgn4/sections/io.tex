We will be storing graphs in specially formatted files. Here is an
example:

\begin{shlisting}{}
$ cat mythical.graph
4
Asgard
Elysium
Olympus
Shangri-La
0 3 5
3 2 4
2 1 10
1 0 2
\end{shlisting}

The first line of a graph file is the number of vertices, or cities, in
the graph. Assuming $n$ is the number of vertices, the next $n$ lines
of the file are the names of the cities. Each line after that is an
edge. It is to be scanned in as a triple $\edge{i}{j}{k}$ and
interpreted as an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ with weight $k$.
