{Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of
its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live
under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The
robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at
some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good
will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of
their own conscience.}}{---C.\xspace S.\xspace Lewis}

\noindent You have been selected through thoroughly democratic processes
(and the machinations of your friend and hero Ernst Blofeld) to be the
Dear and Beloved Leader of the Glorious People's Republic of Santa Cruz
following the failure of the short-lived anarcho-syndicalist commune,
where each person in turn acted as a form of executive officer for the
week but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a
special bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely
internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major
decisions. Where it was understood that strange women lying in ponds
distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme
executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some
farcical aquatic ceremony. It was a very silly place, and so with Herr
Blofeld's assistance you are now the leader of your people.

In order to promote virtue and prevent vice, and to preserve social
cohesion and discourage unrest, you have decided that the Internet
content must be filtered so that your beloved children are not corrupted
through the use of unfortunate, hurtful, offensive, and far too
descriptive language.

You are the giver of all that your creatures love: A full belly twice a
day, and clean straw to roll on.  You bear such imposing titles as
\emph{Eternal General Secretary}, \emph{Supreme Commander of the
People's Surfing Commission}, \emph{Father of all animals, Terror of
mankind, Protector of the sheep-fold, Ducklings' friend,} and
\emph{Friend of the featherless}. You know, above all, that all citizens
of your little republic are equal but some are more equal than others.
And so, your happy little bund sets itself to solving the problem of
offensive speech. What is offensive speech? You can't define it, but as
Justice Potter Stewart once said, ``I know it when I see it.''
