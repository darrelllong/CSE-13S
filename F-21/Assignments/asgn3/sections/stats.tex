\noindent
To facilitate the gathering of statistics, you will be given,
\textcolor{red}{\emph{and must use}}, a small statistics module. The
module itself revolves around the following struct:

\begin{clisting}{}
typedef struct {
  uint64_t moves;
  uint64_t comparisons;
} Stats;
\end{clisting}

The module also includes functions to \emph{compare}, \emph{swap}, and
\emph{move} elements.

\begin{funcdoc}{int cmp(Stats *stats, uint32\_t x, uint32\_t y)}
  Compares \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} and increments the
  \texttt{comparisons} field in \texttt{stats}. Returns \texttt{-1} if
  \texttt{x} is less than \texttt{y}, \texttt{0} if \texttt{x} is equal
  to \texttt{y}, and \texttt{1} if \texttt{x} is greater than
  \texttt{y}.
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}{uint32\_t move(Stats *stats, uint32\_t x)}
  ``Moves'' \texttt{x} by incrementing the \texttt{moves} field in
  \texttt{stats} and returning \texttt{x}. This is intended for use in
  Insertion Sort and Shell Sort, where array elements aren't swapped,
  but instead moved and stored in a temporary variable.
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}{void swap(Stats *stats, uint32\_t *x, uint32\_t *y)}
  Swaps the elements pointed to by pointers \texttt{x} and \texttt{y},
  incrementing the \texttt{moves} field in \texttt{stats} by 3 to
  reflect a swap using a temporary variable.
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}{void reset(Stats *stats)}
  Resets \texttt{stats}, setting the \texttt{moves} field and
  \texttt{comparisons} field to 0. It is possible that you don't end up
  using this specific function, depending on your usage of the
  \texttt{Stats} \texttt{struct}.
\end{funcdoc}
