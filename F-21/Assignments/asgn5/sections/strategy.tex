\section{Strategy}

\epigraph{\emph{I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad
programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data
structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good
programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.}}{---Linus
Torvalds}

\noindent Let's talk strategy.

First, develop the data structures that you will need. Draw pictures,
work them out, implement them, and test them. Test them again. A program
called \texttt{printtree} will be supplied in the resources repository. It
will help you determine whether or not you are constructing and dumping your Huffman
trees correctly.

Do things in small, incremental steps. Make a histogram. Test it with a
small input file. Create a node using a symbol in the histogram. Does
that work? Good, now try putting a tree together. Do the same for the
rest of the data structures. You'll thank yourself later down the road
if you do this.

As with all assignments, a working encoder and decoder will be supplied
in the resources repository. Test if you can decode what the reference
encoder encodes. Test if the reference decoder and decode what your
encoder encodes.

Build your toolkit. Build components. Test them.
