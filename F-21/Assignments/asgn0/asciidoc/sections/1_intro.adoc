== Introduction

"It's nice if people can finally loosen up a little bit and just go out and
laugh at silliness. I mean, people take themselves way too seriously sometimes.
Git'er done!"
-- Larry the Cable Guy

The aim of this first assignment will be for you to set up your GitLab
repositories and gain an understanding of how `git` works. We will review
several `git` commands that you will help you in the long run. This document
will be helpful for troubleshooting `git` issues in the future and also includes
the submission policy. You will find this quite helpful in the future if you
ever have any issues with `git` or submitting. _Ideally_, this assignment should
be completed during your discussion section.
